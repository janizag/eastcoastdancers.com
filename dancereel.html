<h2 class="center">My Dance Bio and Video Reel</h2>
<p class="center">
Janiza Gesmundo started dancing hiphop when she joined her high school’s dance team in the Philippines. She started training at the age of 16 and was trained by mentors from FEU Dance Company, Kinection, The Crew, UP Street Dance Club and more. The Philippine dance community influenced her to keep dancing even after graduating high school.
<br><br>
She moved to New York City in 2012 and started taking hip hop dance classes found from google search. She found RiSE Dance Company who offers hip-hop dance classes in the city, took a beginner’s class and met a few people who introduced her to the New York dance community. She started gaining connections from the community and attended a lot of dance workshops over the summer of 2012.

Later in 2014, she’s been a part of Mint Dance Company, Anonymous Dance and UFP Dance Company. Her favorite part being in the dance community aside from placing at dance competitions is meeting new people who share the same passion for dancing. Being in dance community opened a lot of doors for Janiza as she was able to do commercial and professional back-up dancing on the side while also being enrolled in school full time. Janiza danced in music videos, commercials and concerts around the east coast area.
